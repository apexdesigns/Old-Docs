Town Controls Department of Motor Vehicles section is broken up into 4 sections as well as the landing page. These sections are Basic, Records, Activities, and History. We will explore each section in detail.

## Landing Page 

When you first click on DMV from the navbar you will be taken to the DMV landing page. On this page you will see a simple search field. If it is your first time visiting. This field will auto complete as you type, displaying results as **"character name(secondlife user)"** It will look for your query first in your Town Registration, then in the Social Registration. This search should be contucted by character name and verifyed with secondlife name. Meaning if Johnny Sapphire has the character name of Keegen Sapphire. You would search Keegen Sapphire and just make sure the secondlife user matches who your wanting. If no results are found you will be allowed to create a new record. Please note this will create a new record for both the Town Register and the Social Register, so ensure your being accrute with your infomation.

Once you click on a citizen or create new, a form will popup below the search field. If the result was found by the Social Register you will need to enter the Type, Address, City, State, Zip. If you create a completely new record you will be required to enter all the information in the form. Please do not use special characters in a name. Once you complete required information hit submit and the citizen is automaticly selected for you. If the citizen you selected was already in your Town Register they will be selected automaticly when you click on them. You will also see a delete button a the bottom of the form. As well as a Close button, pressing the close button will close the form and clear out any citizen you have selected.

Now that you have a citizen selected you will see their name listed on the right side of the sub navbar. At this point you can goto any section in the DMV.
